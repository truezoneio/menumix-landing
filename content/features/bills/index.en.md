# Smarter Bill Management

Taking orders at the table is easy, but if things get chaotic at payment time, Menumix has the solution. Our digital bill management feature reduces the workload for your staff and gives your customers a smooth, modern payment experience.

## Splitting the Bill Has Never Been Easier

When there are multiple people at a table, it can be confusing to figure out who owes what. With Menumix, customers can:
- Select and pay only for their own orders  
- Split the total bill evenly  
- Mix payment types like cash and credit card  

Everything is tracked and recorded digitally.

## Live Bill Tracking

What was ordered? When did it arrive? Has it been paid for?  
With Menumix, all bill activity is tracked in real-time:
- Active order list  
- Paid vs. pending items  
- Partial payments, discounts, and promotions  

A true time-saver for cashiers and service staff alike.

## Multiple Payment Methods

Every customer has their own payment preference. With Menumix, you can easily accept:
- Cash  
- Credit/Debit cards  
- QR code payments  
- Mobile wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay)

All from one system.

## Automatic Integration with Kitchen and Cashier

When an order is placed, the kitchen is instantly notified. When itâ€™s paid, the cashier sees it on their screen.  
No need for printed receipts or handwritten notes.

Everything is managed from a single interface.

## Fewer Errors, More Satisfaction

Say goodbye to paper-and-pen bill tracking. With digital bill management:
- The risk of charging the wrong amount disappears  
- Refunds and corrections are simple  
- Clear reports are available at the end of the day
